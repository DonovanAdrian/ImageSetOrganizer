## Welcome!
This is a program that will be used to help my dad with 
organizing the family photos back where they need to go. 
He's essentially the family historian, so he has TONS of 
pictures. Whenever he needs to print out some of those photos, 
he organizes them into three different sets: 1 Print, 2 Prints, 
and 3 Prints. With this, he can decide which photos get saved or 
given away! That's where I come in. He always needs me to 
help put the photos back into the folder where they came from, since 
he isn't very technologically savvy. In the unlikely off-chance that 
I'm not around, I figured I'd make something that can take my place.



## How Well Does This Work?
With a successful transfer, the least efficient path is that of a n^9 
Big O efficiency, and a minimum of n with an unsuccessful transfer. 
With my (ableit limited and biased) testing, all tests were deemed 
successful, with the exception of transfers that did not have any 
files to move. This latter exception is considered a "Transfer Failure" 
in the program's logic. Otherwise, I did my best to include any and 
all error cases and proper handling, even though *almost* none of them 
were triggered during testing.
