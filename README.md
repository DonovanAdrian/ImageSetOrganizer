## Welcome!
This is a program that will be used to help my dad with 
organizing the family photos back where they need to go. 
He's essentially the family historian, so he has TONS of 
pictures. Whenever he needs to print out some of those photos, 
he organizes them into three different sets: 1 Print, 2 Prints, 
and 3 Prints. With this, he can decide which photos get saved or 
given away! That's where I come in. He always needs me to 
help put the photos back into the folder where they came from, since 
he isn't very technologically savvy. In the unlikely off-chance that 
I'm not around, I figured I'd make something that can take my place.



## How Well Does This Work?
I'm not sure yet! This is still in-progress! However, many 
of the functions from my File Extension Editor will be used 
to shuffle around the photos as needed, so you can check 
there if you are really interested with how well this might 
end up working!
